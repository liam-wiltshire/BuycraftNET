# BuycraftNET
A (very) WIP (pre-pre-alpha) implementation of the Buycraft plugin for MiNet

## Supported Features
- Provide Secret

## Notes
MiNET doesn't provide a way to execute string commands, so we've had to create a bit of a hack to do so - hopefully in future there will be a way for us to just execute commands directly. Becuase of the way MiNET works, commands have to executed with a valid sender - we are still looking for a way around this.
